Para(3) -- Perl lib to run parallel jobs
========================================

## SYNOPSIS

 use Para;
 my $p = Para->new(
     job => sub { sleep 1; print $_[0] x 10 . "\n" },
     callback => sub { print shift },
     jobs => 10,
 );
 $p->to_queue(0..9);
 $p->run;

## DESCRIPTION

Above example shall run in about 1s time.

Pass a job as a code reference. Sub shall take a single parameter
and print one output to STDOUT, and optionally indicate an exit status
with a return value.

Optional parameters to new:

* callback: if missing, get results using $p->results
* size: max output size of job in bytes, default 4096
* jobs: max number of parallel jobs, default 1

Pass list of job inputs to to_queue().

Call run() to process jobs, it will call callback for each result, otherwise
use $p->results afterwards.

## INTERNALS

Para forks a process for each job, gets results from them via single
Unix domain socket in SOCK_SEQPACKET mode, guaranteeing message integrity.
